A portfolio template for graphic designers built with 11ty.

## Setup

To start using this repository, first clone it to your own GitHub account.
Open the repository in GitHub Codespaces (click the green Code button, then choose to create a new codespace)
Once the codespace is open, find the terminal, and type the following command:
`npm install`
This will install the project into the codespace environment and install all the tools it needs to build your site.
Once that command finishes, you can start up the site!
In the terminal, type the following command:
`npm run serve`
This command tells the codespace to start a server so you can see your website. Once you run that command, you should see a popup in the corner with **what does this actually say?**
In the terminal you will see a line "Server at http://localhost:8080/". You should be able to either control+click or command+click (depending on Mac or Windows) and you will be able to see your new site!
